			<h5> Getting your pups to the dog park is easy, but coordinating playtime with their canine pals can be a hassle. No more! Bark Buddies is a platform that allows users to check in and out of their local dog park, letting other dog owners know when their pup is ready to play. </h5>

			<h5> Now you don't have to worry about making that trek to the park in the rain only to find out no one else is there... </h5>
