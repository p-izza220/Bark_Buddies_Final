				We want you and your dog to have a fun and safe time. By entering our public dog parks, you agree to be financially responsible for any injury caused by your dog and abide by posted rules. Please do not enter the run if you are not confident of your dogâ€™s ability to interact safely with other people and dogs.

				Washington Square Park has two dog runs - one for small dogs and one for large dogs. While dogs over 25 pounds are not permitted in the small dog run, small dogs are welcome in the large dog run.
